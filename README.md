### - Written By Wh1ppedKreem
So far, I have compiled my knowledge of python (which I have been learning for a few months now) into this project. Since I have an interest in cyber security, I found myself using nmap a lot, usually in CTF challenges, so to make life easier I wrote this tool called EZ Nmap which is the first script I wrote without using any code from the internet. 

UPDATE: I wrote this script ages ago and I am now working on a better, more beginner friendly, much more helpful pentesting framework with many existing tools to improve your workflow and it also focuses on ease of use. Coming soon...

However feel free to still use this tool.

# Description

EZ Nmap allows you to use Nmap quickly and efficiently whether you know or don't know how to use Nmap.

It has various options for scans including:

- Stealth Scan
- Light Scan
- Moderate Scan
- Intense Scan
- Super Scan

# Installation

### Linux Installation:
Clone the repository:

$```git clone https://github.com/Wh1ppedKreem/EZNmap.git```

Go to "nmapscript" Directory:

$```cd nmapscript```

Run EZ Nmap:

$```python3 eznmap.py```

# UPDATE!!
I wrote this script ages ago and I am now working on a pentesting framework that will be released soon.
