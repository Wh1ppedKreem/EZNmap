# EZ Nmap
## - Written By Wh1ppedKreem
So far, I have compiled my knowledge of python (which I have been learning for a few months now) into this project. Since I have an interest in cyber security, I found myself using nmap a lot, whether it was in CTF challenges or bug bounty programs so to make life easier I wrote this tool called EZ Nmap which is the first tool I wrote without using any code from the internet.

# Description

EZ Nmap allows you to use Nmap quickly and efficiently whether you know or don't know how to use Nmap.

It has various options for scans including:

- Stealth Scan
- Light Scan
- Moderate Scan
- Intense Scan
- Super Scan
